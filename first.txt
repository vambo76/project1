Mr Wight reported that all these issues required rapid resolution and that the Design Team wished to resolve these as quickly as possible.  Project costs were monitored by Turner Townsend and the Design Team was confident that there was adequate control in terms of contract administration.  The Convener expressed concern that these unresolved issues would shortly start to impact on the overall programme.  It was noted that at this stage Lend Lease continued to maintain that the programme was still on schedule and that there was sufficient slack in the programme to mitigate such delays.  The Design Team would be monitoring all timescales on the critical path and to date had not identified any critical path delays.  The Project Management Group sought to understand if any eventual overall delay could potentially be the source of another claim from the contractor and the Design Team confirmed that this could be the case but only if the Contactor could demonstrate that this was as a result of delays generated by the Design Team.

In terms of the specific claims, the Design Team would seek to discount the claims relating to the high pressure mist system and the brise soleil brackets in their entirety as these were deemed to be pricing errors on the part of the contractor.  There might be some level of claim accepted for the specialist gas variations but at a much lesser amount.
